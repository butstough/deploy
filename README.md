# deploy
deployment scripts for ubuntu stream PC setup

usage:  
clone this repository, cd into 'deploy' and run deploy.sh

```
git clone https://github.com/butstough/deploy.git  
cd deploy  
./deploy.sh  
```


currently the script installs apt-fast, updates the PC and proceeds to install several software utilities for a gaming/streaming PC setup.  
these are mainly for my own use, feel free to use them but do so at your own risk.
